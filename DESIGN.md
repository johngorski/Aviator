"Flight plan" has a specific meaning in aviation. It includes information about the pilot, passengers, route, and time.

Effectively planning for a flight requires the pilot to collate several sources of information, only a part of which can be known in advance:
 - Route
 - Winds aloft
 - NOTAMs
 - Aircraft performance data

Collating this data is done in the service of completing a safe flight without violating airspace restrictions. Filing a flight plan with the FAA is a free insurance policy against getting lost in terrain. An FAA flight plan has a specific set of outputs that are well-defined.

The exercise of flight planning produces several outputs useful to a pilot.
 - Fuel required
 - Cruising altitudes (bonus: optimal cruising altitudes!)
 - Frequencies for
   - Communication
     - With air traffic
     - With Flight Watch
   - Weather
   - Navigation aids
     - VOR
     - NDB
 - Time enroute
 - Go/No-go based on
   - Weight & Balance
   - Weather
   - Aircraft airworthiness
 - NOTAM summary
   - TFRs
   - AIRMETs/SIGMETs
   - Runway and taxiway closures
 - Airport information
   - Diagrams
   - Approach procedures
   - Runway and Taxiway geometry

Proper flight planning is taught as a rigorous process, but this doesn't have to be the case. Worse for the general aviation pilot, this presentation discourages thoroughness. Here's the plan:

Pilots may enter Routes in advance. Once entered, scanning NOTAMs for TFRs, runway closures, etc. can alert the Pilot to needed changes to any planned flights using this route.

Pilots may associate a Route with one or more Flights. A Flight is just what it sounds like: all information relevant to a particular one-way flight. Here's a composition sketch:
